# SimpleVision


During the DH2016 conference, @lunactic and I realized how little image analysis and computer vision technologies were used by the community.

Our conclusion was that we, as the computer vision community in DH, can do better. The lack of an easy-to-use library being mostly to blame.

## Approach

- We need to identify the main vision tasks needed by the community.
- We need to provide extremely easy-to-use black-box functions satisfying these needs.
- The users could use these functions on their machines or via the cloud based DIVAServices.

## How can you help us?

We are in the first phase of identifying the tasks needed to be implemented. You can add an issue on this very repo to discuss a task we would want us to implement.
